I am currently striving to improve my web design skills with assistance of this [awesome designer](http://rachidmrad.com) at University of District of Columbia in Washington DC. To be honest, I was underestimating the importance of visual design for a long time. Now I realized that even if I am focused on a back-end development, being able to create something beautiful is a valuable ability.


My goal is to gain insight into web design and to be aware of good design so that I will be able to avoid making unattractive or hard-to-use user interfaces as I develop applications. I am so excited about learning web design.
