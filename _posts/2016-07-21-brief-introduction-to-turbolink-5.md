I gave a talk about Turbolinks 5 at [Node DC](https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/232620835/). I was excited about Turblinks 5 itself and also wanted to practice public speaking.
As it turned out, it was not bad. It was a great experience. It is awesome that the organizer chose mine for his tweet!
